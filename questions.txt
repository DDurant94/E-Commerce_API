Project Requirements
To successfully build our e-commerce application and achieve the learning objectives, we need to establish clear project requirements. 
These requirements outline the key features and functionalities that our application must encompass. Below, you'll find a comprehensive 
list of project requirements based on our learning objectives:

**Note:** We've already developed key functionalities for our e-commerce project in the "Module 6: API REST Development" 
lessons, including models, schemas, and endpoints for Customers and Products. To save time and maintain consistency, 
consider reusing the Flask-SQLAlchemy project as a foundation for Orders and Shopping Cart components. 
This approach ensures a unified and efficient codebase, making it easier to integrate new features into the existing solution.

essential order details. Each order should capture the order date and the associated customer.

4.2. Retrieve Order: Done
Implement an endpoint that allows customers to retrieve details of a specific order based on its unique identifier (ID). 
Provide a clear overview of the order, including the order date and associated products.

4.3. Track Order: DONE
Develop functionality that enables customers to track the status and progress of their orders. 
Customers should be able to access information such as order dates and expected delivery dates.

B.4.4. Manage Order History (Bonus): 
Create an endpoint that allows customers to access their order history, listing all previous orders placed. 
Each order entry should provide comprehensive information, including the order date and associated products.

B.4.5. Cancel Order (Bonus): 
Implement an order cancellation feature, allowing customers to cancel an order if it hasn't been shipped or completed. 
Ensure that canceled orders are appropriately reflected in the system.

B.4.6. Calculate Order Total Price (Bonus): 
Include an endpoint that calculates the total price of items in a specific order, considering the prices of 
the products included in the order. This calculation should be specific to each customer and each order, providing accurate 
pricing information.



Database Integration:
1. Utilize Flask-SQLAlchemy to integrate a MySQL database into the application.
2. Design and create the necessary Model to represent customers, orders, products, customer accounts, and any additional features.
3. Establish relationships between tables to model the application's core functionality.
4. Ensure proper database connections and interactions for data storage and retrieval.
5. Data Validation and Error Handling:
6. Implement data validation mechanisms to ensure that user inputs meet specified criteria (e.g., valid email addresses, proper formatting).
7. Use try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to guide users.


User Interface (Postman):
1. Develop Postman collections that categorize and group API requests according to their functionality. DONE
Separate collections for Customer Management, Product Management, Order Management, and Bonus Features should be created for clarity.


GitHub Repository:
1. Create a GitHub repository for the project and commit code regularly.
2. Maintain a clean and interactive README.md file in the GitHub repository, providing clear instructions on how to run the 
application and explanations of its features.
3. Include a link to the GitHub repository in the project documentation.


Effective Project Communication:
1. Create a video presentation or explanation of the E-commerce API project.
2. Demonstrate the ability to explain technical concepts and project details in a concise and understandable manner.

Submission:
1. Upon completing the project, submit your code and video, including all source code files, and the README.md file in your 
GitHub repository to your instructor or designated platform.

Project Tips:
Building an e-commerce application can be both exciting and challenging. To help you navigate this journey successfully and 
achieve the project requirements, here are some valuable tips to keep in mind:

1. Start with a Strong Foundation:
Code Reusability: 
As mentioned in the project requirements, consider reusing the Flask-SQLAlchemy project you developed during the 
"Module 6: API REST Development" lessons. This will save you time and maintain consistency in your codebase, making it easier to 
integrate new features.

2. Plan Your Database Structure:
Model Design: 
Carefully design your database models to accurately represent customers, orders, products, customer accounts, and 
any additional features you plan to incorporate. Ensure that you establish the necessary relationships between tables to model 
your application's core functionality effectively.

3. Data Validation and Error Handling:
Data Validation: 
Implement robust data validation mechanisms to ensure that user inputs meet specified criteria. 
This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing issues down the line.

Error Handling: 
Utilize try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle errors gracefully. Provide informative error messages that 
guide users in troubleshooting and resolving issues.

4. Thorough Testing with Postman:
Postman Collections: 
Create organized Postman collections that categorize and group API requests based on functionality. 
This will make it easier to test and validate different parts of your application.
Documentation: 
Include clear documentation within your Postman collections and requests. This documentation should guide users on how to use 
each request effectively. Comments and descriptions should be concise and informative.

5. GitHub Repository and Version Control:
Repository Management: 
Establish a GitHub repository for your project and commit code regularly. Utilize version control to keep track of 
changes and collaborate effectively with team members if applicable.
README.md: 
Maintain a clean and interactive README.md file in your GitHub repository. Provide clear instructions on how to run the 
application and explanations of its features. Include a link to your GitHub repository in your project documentation.

6. Effective Communication:
Project Presentation: 
Consider creating a video presentation or explanation of your E-commerce API project. This can be an excellent opportunity to 
showcase your understanding of technical concepts and project details in a concise and understandable manner.
Remember that building a robust e-commerce application is a process that involves careful planning, coding, testing, and documentation. 
By following these project tips and adhering to the requirements, you'll be well on your way to creating a successful and 
feature-rich e-commerce platform. Good luck with your project!
